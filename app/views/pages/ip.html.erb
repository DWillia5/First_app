<h1>IP Networks</h1>
<p>My third placement was in the IP Networks and Security Design team. My role was quite different to what I was expecting it to be. Rather than learning the basics about IP, I was asked to take up a Business Analysis role in which I helped to monitor the workload and performance of the team. The role included setting up a Yammer group for the team containing an individual thread for each project, this was so that people inside and outside of the team could keep track of which stage a project was at. I worked closely with my placement manager, almost on a day to day basis we would meet up and discuss progress. I found it a little bit demanding and not very enjoyable at times, but I learned a lot of personal skills and how to deal with certain situations. </p>
