<h1>Test & Online</h1>
<p>After my time in Core Networks I moved on to the Test team over in Buckingham Avenue. This was a very enjoyable placement with a good mixture of theory learning and practical hands on work. I spent the first period of the placement working in the testbed, contributing to some cabling work and seeing the physical nodes that knit the network together. After that I moved on to a few other teams doing some different types of testing, such as new mobile devices and pay & go top ups. I also took part in a 3 day software testing course, it was very difficult for someone with little experience like myself, unfortunately I didn't get enough marks in the test at the end of the course to earn the pass certificate.  </p>
